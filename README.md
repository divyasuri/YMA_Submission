# YMA 2017 Business Submission

In 2017, I was a recipient of this national scholarship for talent in the fashion/retail industry. This was my submission for the fund.

Founded in 1937, The YMA Fashion Scholarship fund is an international non-profit organization composed of influential members of the fashion industry. The Fashion Scholarship Fundâ€™s goal is to advance the fashion industry by encouraging gifted and enterprising young people to pursue careers in design, merchandising, retailing and business so the industry will continue to attract dedicated, capable and creative individuals.
